[Beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source](https://als.lbl.gov/beamlines/8-3-1/) is operated by
the University of California Office of the President, Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives
grant MR-15-328599, the National Institutes of Health (R01 GM124149 and P30 GM124169),
Plexxikon Inc. and the Integrated Diffraction Analysis Technologies (IDAT) program of the US
Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The Advanced Light Source
(Berkeley, CA) is a national user facility operated by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on
behalf of the US Department of Energy under contract number DE-AC02-05CH11231, Office of Basic
Energy Sciences.

Beamline 8.3.1 is directed by James Holton. Additional hardware and software support are provided by
George Meigs and Scott Classen. Scheduling and access is handled by Kathryn Burnett.
The Participating Research Team includes UCSF, UC Berkeley, The University of California System,
and Plexxikon Inc, and is headed by James Fraser and Robert Stroud.

## Detector

Pilatus3 S 6M with up to 100Hz data collection.

## Beam Characteristics

Beam energy at 8.3.1 is tunable, with a useful range between 6 and 18 keV (2 to 0.7 Å). For native
data at 8.3.1 we usually run at 11111 eV (1.116 Å) where we get 1e12 photons/s through a 100 μm
aperture.  Native beam size is a Gaussian shape with full-width at half-max of 80 x 60 μm (v x h)
at the sample. You can aperture this down with 100, 75, 50, 30, 20, and 15 μm holes.
These apertures reduce the flux, but the lifetime of the crystal stays the same. What you are
throwing away is flux that misses the crystal and ends up as background.

## What we do

* ### Help you collect data!

  Data collections are typically 3-5 minutes before we hit the cryo damage limit.  Room temperature
  collection is also getting more popular, and then lifetimes are 1-2 seconds without attenuation.

* ### Remote data collection

  [Remote-access](/procedures/remote_procedures/remote) at beamline 8.3.1 is supported, and we are accepting remote users. We support all
  puck, cassette, and pin types, including canes.

* ### Automated data processing

  Data processing with XDS launches automatically with each collection (even for industrial users,
  as we have an industrial license for XDS). You can take the processed data home!  We do allow you
  to login and continue processing your data indefinitely after your beam time, but on a somewhat
  slower computer (8 cores).  The 72-core box is reserved for active users doing real-time
  processing.  We tend to keep images on disk for about 6 months before they are only on tape.
  After that we can restore from tape on request.

## Tom Alber

Professor Tom Alber [passed away](http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/04/04/berkeley-professor-thomas-alber-dies-at-60/) in 2014. He spearheaded the construction of Beamline 8.3.1 and ensured that it was a home for innovative structural biology. In 2017, we renamed the beamline the "TomAlberTron" in honor of Tom. We miss him.
