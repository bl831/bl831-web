![ALS](/static/pictures/als_facility.png)
## Technical specifications
* #### General:
	* **Applications:** Protein crystallography (PX), Small-molecule crystallography, X-ray diffraction (XRD)
	* **Primary detector:** Pilatus3 S 6M with up to 25Hz data collection
	* **Secondary detector:** Hitachi Vortex EX energy-resolving for MAD and excitation scans

* #### Beam characteristics:
	* **Min-Max energy (EV):** 5000-17000
	* **Wavelength range (Å):** 0.73-0.25
	* **Flux/brightness:**  1.0 x 10e12 photons/s measured at 3 x 0.35 milliradian divergence at 11,111 eV with ALS at 500 mA
	* **Flux/brightness:**  1.0 x 10e12 photons/s measured at 3 x 0.35 milliradian divergence at 11,111 eV with ALS at 500 mA
	* **Resolving power:**  Water-cooled flat double Si(111) Khozu monochromator:
E/ΔE = 7,000 measured with Ge(11,1,1water-cooled silicon bent into parabola 200 nanoradian slope ) analyzer crystal
		* Primary Mirror: flat internallyerror
		* Secondary Mirror: uncooled cyllindrical silicon bent into torroid
		* 2:1 demagnification
		* Both mirrors coated with Pt/Rh
	* **Spot size:**	0.08 x 0.06 mm (v x h)
* #### Additional features:
	* Sample temperature adjustable from 100-300K
	* "Cool Hand Luke" Robot accepts all major pin types (Hampton, Yale, SPINE, etc.) and lengths (10-24 mm) and supports "delayed data collection mode" where data collection runs are deferred to the end of the shift. This robot does not work directly with cassettes because hand-mounting of samples in the mini-hutch is faster than any robot.
	* **In-Situ Tray Goniometer:** Goniometer is fast air-bearing spindle capable of "true" MAD with round-robin inverse beam and wavelength changes
		* All SBS compliant crystallization trays supported. Thin-walled in-situ ready trays such as in-situ-1 highly recommended
		* Ambient temperature only currently supported

<!-- ## Beam Characteristics
Beam energy at all ALS beamlines except 5.0.1 and 5.0.3 is tunable, with useful range between 6 and 18 keV (2 A to 0.7 A).  For native data at 8.3.1 we usually run at 11111 eV (1.116 A) where we get 1e12 photons/s through a 100 micron aperture.  Native beam size is a Gaussian shape with full-width at half-max of 80 x 60 microns (v x h) at the sample. You can aperture this down with 100,75,50,30,20 and 15 micron holes using a pull-down menu.  These apertures reduce the flux, but the lifetime of the crystal stays the same.  What you are throwing away is flux that misses the crystal and ends up as background. -->
