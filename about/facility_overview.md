## Technical specifications

### General

* **Applications:** Protein crystallography (PX), Small-molecule crystallography, X-ray diffraction (XRD)
* **Primary Detector:** Pilatus3 S 6M with up to 100Hz data collection
* **Secondary Detector:** Hitachi Vortex EX energy-resolving for MAD and excitation scans

### Beam characteristics

* **Min-Max Energy (eV):**  5000-17000
* **Wavelength Range (Å):**  0.73-0.25
* **Flux/Brightness:**  1.0 x 10e12 photons/s measured at 3 x 0.35 milliradian divergence at 11,111 eV with ALS at 500 mA

* **Resolving Power:**  Water-cooled flat double Si(111) Khozu monochromator:
  * E/ΔE = 7,000 measured with Ge(11,1,1water-cooled silicon bent into parabola 200 nanoradian slope ) analyzer crystal
  * Primary Mirror: flat internally cooled.
  * Secondary Mirror: uncooled cyllindrical silicon bent into torroid
  * 2:1 demagnification
  * Both mirrors coated with Pt/Rh

* **Focussed Spot Size at Sample Position:**  0.08 x 0.06 mm (v x h)

### Additional features

* Sample temperature adjustable from 100-300K
* "Cool Hand Luke" Robot accepts all major pin types (Hampton, Yale, SPINE, etc.) and lengths (10-24 mm) and supports fully automatic unattended screening and data collection. This robot does not work directly with pucks or cassettes, but rather we will load the CHL sample chain manually (current capacity is 50 pins). Plans are afoot to develop a puck/cassette unpacking robot that will accept standard unipucks and SSRL-style cassettes and load the CHL sample chain.
* **In-Situ Tray Goniometer:** Goniometer is fast air-bearing spindle capable of "true" MAD with round-robin inverse beam and wavelength changes
* All SBS compliant crystallization trays supported. Thin-walled in-situ ready trays such as in-situ-1 highly recommended
* Ambient temperature data collection supported
