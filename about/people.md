## Tom Alber, PhD

Professor Tom Alber [passed away](http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/04/04/berkeley-professor-thomas-alber-dies-at-60/) in 2014. He spearheaded the construction of Beamline 8.3.1 and ensured that it was a home for innovative structural biology. In 2017, we renamed the beamline the "TomAlberTron" in honor of Tom. We miss him.
