# Getting Beamtime

---

## **Step 1 : Submit one of these two types of proposals** 

- ### **General User Proposal (GUP)**

  - ### Submitting a General User Proposal is the most common way for users to access a beamline. The process accommodates users who want to establish an ongoing program of work at the ALS or who want to carry out a single experiment requiring more beamtime than is available through the RAPIDD system. Proposals may be submitted every six months and can remain active for up to two years.

  - ### Log in to [ALSHub](https://alshub.als.lbl.gov/) to submit a General User Proposal (GUP).

- ### **RAPIDD Proposal**

  - ### The RAPIDD proposal process accommodates users requiring limited but rapid access to ALS beamtime. It includes rapid access for general science and structural biology users, industry users, and those wishing to be considered for directorâ€™s discretionary beamtime. **Proposals may be submitted at any time**.

  - ### Log in to [ALSHub](https://alshub.als.lbl.gov/) to submit a RAPIDD Proposal.

## **Step 2 : Request beamtime from 8.3.1 staff**

- ### Go to the [8.3.1 calendar](https://bl831.als.lbl.gov/~mcfuser/schedule/schedule.php) to find available shifts. The orange "COVID19/PRT/GU" shifts indicate availability.

- ### Email [Kathryn](mailto:kburnett@lbl.gov) and cc [George](mailto:gmeigs@lbl.gov) to request the shift you want. If possible, give us a couple of options. First choice, second choice, etc. 

## **HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO COLLECT :**

## **Do you want to collect in person?**

- ### **First :** Inform [Kathryn](mailto:kburnett@lbl.gov) and [George](mailto:GMeigs@lbl.gov) that you would like to collect in person.

- ### **Second :** Update your arrival time in your [ALSHub account](https://alshub.als.lbl.gov/).

  - ### This will activate the on-site access process and send a message to the ALS User office. You should receive notification about next steps. Only the ALS user office has access to this information. We are not able to access that information so can't tell you exactly what you need to do.

- ### **Third :** Make sure you have an active badge.

  - ### If your badge is not active, we recommend starting [this process](https://als.lbl.gov/onsite-access/) at least 1 month before your proposed beamtime.

  - ### Follow this [link](https://als.lbl.gov/users/user-guide/) for a more conprehensive user guide.

## **Do you want to collect remotely?**

  - ### You do not need to have an active badge to collect remotely. 
  
  - ### Coordinate with [George](mailto:gmeigs@lbl.gov) about shipping or dropping off your dewar. You will also need to give him your crystal information. George will set up your crystals for remote collection.
  
  - ### Please follow our [remote collection procedures](https://tomalbertron.als.lbl.gov/procedures/remote_procedures/remote/). 
  
## **Do you want to collect in situ? or some other weird way?**

- ### Contact [George](mailto:GMeigs@lbl.gov), [James](mailto:JMHolton@lbl.gov), and [Scott](mailto:sclassen@lbl.gov).
