## General Procedures
__Do not interfere with other people's beam time.__ If you are doing processing after your beam time, try to remember to restrict your CPU activity to "crush17."

__Do NOT restore any files to /data unless you know how to preserve their date stamps.__ Image files with new dates will be mistaken for newly-collected data and mess up the automatic archiver.
