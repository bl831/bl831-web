3. Request a login from us.
4. Connect, and create a new session (for first time you connect) or select existing session if one
   exists.
5. I'm sure there are more details we could add, but hopefully it's fairly self explanitory. Just 
   contact us if you have any problems getting connected or configured a remote desktop session.

## Load sample list using crystal-server webapp

Blu-Ice requires a list of your crystals losded as an Excel spreadsheet. You can download template
files and uplaod pre-filled `*.xls` files on the [Crystal Server](https://bl831.als.lbl.gov/crystal-server)

Again, it should be self explanitory. Please contact us if you run into problems.
