# Remote Procedures

---

Whether you are collecting manually or using the beamline for fully automatic unattended screening
you will access the Blu-Ice control software from a linux desktop using a NoMachine NX client.

## Connect to beamline using NoMachine NX

1. Make sure you have the latest version of NoMachine's [NX Client](https://www.nomachine.com/download)  

2. Configure your connection profile thusly:

3. Request a login from us.
4. Connect, and create a new session (for first time you connect) or select existing session if one
   exists.
5. I'm sure there are more details we could add, but hopefully it's fairly self explanitory. Just
   contact us if you have any problems getting connected or configured a remote desktop session.

## Load sample list using crystal-server webapp

If you will use the unattended screening features of Blu-Ice you will be required to upload a list
of your crystals as an Excel spreadsheet. You can download template Excell files and uplaod your
filled out spreadsheets to the [Crystal Server](https://bl831.als.lbl.gov/crystal-server).

Again, it should be self explanitory. Please contact us if you run into problems.
