# Remote Procedures

---

Whether you are collecting manually or using the beamline for fully automatic unattended screening
you will access the Blu-Ice control software from a linux desktop using a NoMachine NX client.

## Connect to beamline using NoMachine NX

1. Make sure you have the latest version of NoMachine's
   [NX Client](https://www.nomachine.com/download)  

2. Configure your connection profile thusly:

3. Request a login.

4. Connect to the gateway using NX, and create a new session (for first time you connect) or select
   existing session if one already exists.

5. Open a terminal window and launch Blu-Ice by typing `go`.

6. I'm sure there are more details we could add, but hopefully it's fairly self explanatory. Just
   contact us if you have any problems getting connected or configuring a remote desktop session.

## Load sample list using crystal-server webapp

If you will use the screening or unattended data collection features of Blu-Ice you will be required
to upload a list of your crystals as an Excel spreadsheet. You can download template Excel files
and uplaod your filled out spreadsheets to the
[Crystal Server](https://bl831.als.lbl.gov/crystal-server).

Again, it should be self explanatory. Please contact us if you run into problems.
